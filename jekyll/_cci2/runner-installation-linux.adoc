This page describes how to install CircleCI self-hosted runner on Linux.

{% include snippets/runner-platform-prerequisites.adoc %}

[#create-the-circleci-self-hosted-runner-configuration]
== Create the CircleCI self-hosted runner configuration

Create a `launch-agent-config.yaml` file. 

```shell
sudo touch /var/opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
```

Copy and paste into the newly created file the recommended CircleCI self-hosted runner configuration for Linux:

```yaml
api:
  auth_token: AUTH_TOKEN
  # On server, set url to the hostname of your server installation. For example,
  # url: https://circleci.example.com

runner:
  name: RUNNER_NAME
  command_prefix: ["sudo", "-niHu", "USERNAME", "--"]
  working_directory: /var/opt/circleci/workdir
  cleanup_working_directory: true
```

- Replace `AUTH_TOKEN` with the resource class token created in the xref:runner-installation.adoc#authentication[Authentication] step
- Replace `RUNNER_NAME` with the name you would like for your self-hosted runner
- `RUNNER_NAME` is unique to the the machine that is installing the runner
- `RUNNER_NAME` can be any value you would like, and it does not need to include any part of your namespace or resource class name
- `USERNAME` is the user on your machine that you want to run the runner launch agent
- This is not your CircleCI account username, but the user on the machine that the agent will be installed on

[#install-the-circleci-self-hosted-runner-configuration]
== Install the CircleCI self-hosted runner configuration

Once created, save the configuration file to `/var/opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml` owned by `root` with permissions `600`:

```shell
sudo chown root: /var/opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
```

```shell
sudo chmod 600 /var/opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
```

[#create-the-username-user-and-working-directory]
== Create the USERNAME user and working directory

These will be used when executing the task agent. These commands must be run as a user with permissions to create other users (e.g. `root`). For information about GECOS, see the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field[wiki page].

[#ubuntu-debian]
=== Ubuntu/Debian

```shell
id -u USERNAME &>/dev/null || sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos GECOS USERNAME

sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/circleci/workdir
sudo chown -R USERNAME /var/opt/circleci/workdir
sudo chmod 0750 /var/opt/circleci/workdir
```

Consider running the following additional command if you would like to use certified orbs that work on Cloud on your self-hosted runner, without errors. Note that this enables code to execute root commands on your machine, and changes to the system may persist after the job is run.

```shell
echo "USERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

[#centos-rhel]
=== CentOS/RHEL

```shell
id -u USERNAME &>/dev/null || sudo adduser -c GECOS USERNAME

sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/circleci/workdir
sudo chown -R USERNAME /var/opt/circleci/workdir
sudo chmod 0750 /var/opt/circleci/workdir
```

Consider running the following additional command if you would like to use certified orbs that work on Cloud on your self-hosted runner, without errors. Note that this enables code to execute root commands on your machine, and changes to the system may persist after the job is run.

```shell
echo "circleci ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

[#configure-selinux-policy]
== Configure SELinux policy (RHEL 8)

An SELinux policy is required for self-hosted runner to accept and launch jobs on RHEL 8 systems (earlier versions of RHEL are unsupported). Note that this policy does not add any permissions to the ones that may be required by individual jobs on this self-hosted runner install.

Create directory `/opt/circleci/policy` and generate the initial policy module:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /opt/circleci/policy

# Install sepolicy and rpmbuild if you haven't already
sudo yum install -y policycoreutils-devel
sudo yum install -y rpm-build

sudo sepolicy generate --path /opt/circleci/policy --init /opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent
```

Download the following type enforcing file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircleCI-Public/runner-installation-files/main/rhel8-install/circleci_launch_agent.te[`circleci_launch_agent.te`] and install the policy:

```shell
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircleCI-Public/runner-installation-files/main/rhel8-install/circleci_launch_agent.te --output /opt/circleci/policy/circleci_launch_agent.te

sudo /opt/circleci/policy/circleci_launch_agent.sh
```

[#verify-the service-is-running]
=== Verify the service is running

The system reports a very basic health status through the `status` field in `systemctl`. This will report **Healthy** or **Unhealthy** based on connectivity to the CircleCI APIs.

You can see the status of the agent by running:

```shell
systemctl status circleci.service --no-pager
```

Which should produce output similar to:

```
circleci.service - CircleCI Runner
   Loaded: loaded (/opt/circleci/circleci.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-05-29 14:33:31 UTC; 18min ago
 Main PID: 5592 (circleci-launch)
   Status: "Healthy"
    Tasks: 8 (limit: 2287)
   CGroup: /system.slice/circleci.service
           └─5592 /opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent --config /var/opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
```

You can also see the logs for the system by running:

```shell
journalctl -u circleci
```

[#enable-the-systemd-unit]
== Enable the `systemd` unit

NOTE: This step is optional.

You will need to have https://systemd.io/[systemd] version 235+ installed for this optional step.

Create `/opt/circleci/circleci.service` owned by `root` with permissions `755`.

```shell
sudo chown root: /opt/circleci/circleci.service
```

```shell
sudo chmod 755 /opt/circleci/circleci.service
```

You must ensure that `TimeoutStopSec` is greater than the total amount of time a task will run for - which defaults to 5 hours.

If you want to configure the CircleCI self-hosted runner installation to start on boot, it is important to note that the launch agent will attempt to consume and start jobs as soon as it starts, so it should be configured appropriately before starting. The launch agent may be configured as a service and be managed by `systemd` with the following scripts:

```
[Unit]
Description=CircleCI Runner
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=/var/opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent --config /var/opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
Restart=always
User=root
NotifyAccess=exec
TimeoutStopSec=18300
[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```

Unlike the task agent, which uses the environment of the `circleci` user, the launch agent will need to have any required environment variables (e.g., proxy settings) explicitly defined in the unit configuration file. These can be set by `Environment=` or `EnvironmentFile=`. https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#Environment[Please visit the `systemd` documentation for more information].

You can now enable the service:

```shell
systemctl enable /var/opt/circleci/circleci.service
```

[#start-the-service]
== Start the service

When the CircleCI self-hosted runner service starts, it will immediately attempt to start running jobs, so it should be fully configured before the first start of the service.

```shell
systemctl start circleci.service
```
